## Description of design:

We coined the term "Great Value Audacity" when working on this project, it takes in an 8 bit or 16 bit wav file, and with that wav file has three functionalities. It can edit metadata as well as on to it, manipulate the audio to either echo, noisegate, or normalize it, and it can export existing technical information and metadata to a .csv file.  This is all done via a centralized menu in the terminal, where different class objects are called to be implemented into the menu. ![Class Diagram](https://github.com/cpe-unr/group-project-pt2-r-amin-j-herup-p-nipay/blob/user-interaction/Class_Diagram.png)


## Challenges while developing

There was thankfully no trouble in communicating with each other. Our struggles involved extracting and writing the metadata, as well as how to work with the two channels in stereo output. User interaction was of course a breeze, albeit a tedious one. Implementing fileWrite and fileRead functions proved to be challenging as well.
